# Cascade_Cup_2022

**IIT Guwahati's Consulting and Analytics Club** in association with **Shadowfax** conducted Cascade Cup'22 during the month of February 2022. Our **Team Brute_Force** secured **1st place** in the cascade cup competition among 1000+ participants.The competition was conducted in 3 rounds, each being eliminatory.
- **Round 1**: Data Science Quiz
- **Round 2**: Machine Learning Hackathon
- **Round 3**: Data Analysis Report

In this repo, we have published our work from the 2nd and 3rd round. 

## **Round 2: Machine Learning Hackathon**

The hackathon was hosted on Kaggle platform. 

#### **Background:**

At Shadowfax, part of the business includes delivering food orders from clients such as Swiggy and Zomato to customers. The typical order flow goes something like this:
- A client creates the order in our system
- The order gets allocated to a rider
- The rider accepts the order
- The rider goes to the pickup location
- The rider picks up the order
- The rider goes to the delivery location and delivers the order

The rider also has the option to get the order cancelled before delivery by calling the clientâ€™s call centre. We would like to predict this kind of cancellation before it happens so that we can try and reassign the order to another rider before it gets cancelled.

#### **Problem Statement:**

Given the order and rider details as described below, create a model that can predict rider-driven cancellation in advance (i.e. before getting marked as cancelled or delivered).

## **Round 3: Data Analysis Report**

Given the dataset, the task is to compile a detailed Data analysis report based on the dataset. Use graphs
to make as many significant inferences and relationships as possible.
